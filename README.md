## Project Overview

### Objectives

- **Graffiti Detection**: Utilize YOLOv8 to detect graffiti in Google Street View images.
- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Analyze graffiti content and distribution in Novi Sad.
- **Method Comparison**: Compare the strengths and weaknesses of field trips versus Google Street View for graffiti data collection.

#### Google Street View
Google Street View offers:
- Large geographical coverage and the convenience of collecting data online.
- The ability to rapidly capture graffiti from broad areas, making it ideal for initial surveys or large-scale studies.

**Limitations:**
- Variability in image quality due to factors like lighting, angle, distance, and camera resolution.
- Manual verification is required to ensure data accuracy and relevance.
- The quantity of graffiti detected depends on the performance of the detection model.
- Data collection efficiency is influenced by Google Street View's sampling distance, with smaller distances lowering speed and larger distances potentially missing graffiti.
